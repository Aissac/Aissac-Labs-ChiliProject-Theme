# Aissac Labs Redmine Theme

## Basecamp + GitHub Redmine Theme

I really like [GitCamp](https://github.com/kennethreitz/redmine-gitcamp-theme) as a ChiliProject (and Redmine) theme but wanted just a bit of customization for Aissac Labs.

## Installation

1. Copy `aissaclabs` into ChiliProject's `public/themes/`
1. Enable Aissac Labs in your Admin Panel
1. [Fork it](https://github.com/Aissac/Aissac-Labs-ChiliProject-Theme/fork) and make it even better :)
